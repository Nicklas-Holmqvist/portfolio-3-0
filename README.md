# Nicklasfoto 3.0

## Goal
Create with as much semantic html and accessability I can. It will not be perfect but one step in the right way.

## Content
This is my second redone of my personal photography portfolio this year(2022).
The first go was a simple ReactJS/Typescript page with almost all data fetched from Contentful.
Styling wise I tryed out alot of different methods and that made the project very messy.
Since then I also learned a different approch how to build and structure my files.
That project on [Github](https://github.com/Nicklas-Holmqvist/new-photography-portfolio)

I wanted to create a more storybased content from start to end. More information about my personal project Glömd värld and short stories about the tree different galleries I wanted to show.

## Tech-stack
- NextJS@latest
- Typescript
- Styled-components

This will be the base design, header is fixed to the top and balance the layout per section well.

## Future
I want to create a buy feature for my photographs. So I need to create a productpage, checkout and connect payment.
The productpage isn't the hardest part for me but have to read up on how to fix the payment.
