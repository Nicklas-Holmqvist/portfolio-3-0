# Nicklasfoto 3.0

## Content
This is my second redone of my personal photography portfolio this year(2022).
The first go was a simple ReactJS/Typescript page with almost all data fetched from Contentful.
Styling wise I tryed out alot of different methods and that made the project very messy.
Since then I also learned a different approch how to build and structure my files.
That project on [Github](https://github.com/Nicklas-Holmqvist/new-photography-portfolio)

I wanted to create a more storybased content from start to end. More information about my personal project Glömd värld and short stories about the tree different galleries I wanted to show.
